# Chip-s-Challenge-Assignment

An assignment from my university which require us to work in groups, creating our 
own version of Chip's Challenge using JavaFx.

Implemented:
- The basic game
- Leaderboard system, which shows the top 3 player in each level and update 
  everytime a player finishes his/her game
- A profile system, which allows players to create their own profile in the start
  of the game and save/load their game
- An inventory view, which shows the inventory of the player

Most images are found in the internet and other games.

Overall mark for the assignment: 75/100

Things to improve:
- Coding style (bad namings and some method contains hundred lines of 
  code which increase the chance of error and is hard for others to understand.
- Documenting (some methods are not documented correctly with incorrect syntax and summary)
